# Revati's Maze Game

#### Description


I am designing a game where the player is lost in a forest and needs to have 3 points to escape. Throughout the maze, the player will be able to approach various "Challenge Points" (represented by ghosts) where a ghost will ask the player a randomly generated trivia question for the player to proceed. If the player gets 3 questions wrong, they will lose the game. If the player can answer 3 questions correctly, they win!

Please see seperately attached document.

#### API
I will be using a Trivia API to generate random trivia questions.

#### Features
My game will include the following features:
- A forest that can be navigated with arrow keys (unsure how this will be built)
- Images for the player and NPCs.
- In-screen pop-ups with a question and response buttons for each Challenge Point (can I do an alert?)

#### Stretch Goals
- Add a reset button to the game where the game is scrambled to a new board once reset. (DONE)
- Have each point be represented by a randomly generated "Escape Gem" image that pushes to the top right of the screen when the player answers a question correctly. (DONE)
- Have each loss be represented by a heart image, where the last image is removed when the player answers a question incorrectly. (DONE)
- An initial screen where the game asks for the player's name so it can be referenced later in the game. (IN PROGRESS)
- Make the character "walk" using the toggle class function to toggle between different images for the character when the player hits the left, right, up, and down key. (IN PROGRESS)
