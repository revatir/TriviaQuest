# Revati's Maze Game

#### Description

I am designing a game where the player is embarking on a journey through a maze. Throughout the maze will be a TBD number of Challenge Points where an NPC will ask the player a randomly generated question for the player to proceed. If the player gets a TBD number of questions wrong, they will have to start the game back at the beginning. If the player can pass through each Challenge Point and reach the end of the maze, they win!

Please see seperately attached document.

#### API
I will be using a Trivia API to generate random trivia questions.

#### Features
My game will include the following features:
- An initial screen where the game asks for the player's name so it can be referenced later in the game.
- A maze that can be navigated with arrow keys (unsure how this will be built)
- Images for the player and NPCs.
- In-screen pop-ups with a question and response buttons for each Challenge Point (can I do an alert?)

#### Stretch Goals
- Add a nav bar that links to an "About the Developer" page.
- Add a reset button to the game
- Add pption for player to choose gender of their player.
- Replace the Challenge Point questions with mini games that get progressively more difficult.
- Add multiple levels so the player can advance to a more challenging play arena after winning level 1.
- Develop each Challenge Point into maybe a mini-village or town in which the challenging NPC resides to flesh out the story of the game. 
- Use the Spotify API for background music, and plan to use different songs for the following purposes:
- **General music** - a song that loops over while the player travels through the maze.
- **Challenge music** - a song for when the player faces a Challenge Point.
- **Win music** - a song for when the player wins the game.
- **Lose music** - a song for when the player loses the game.
